This script uses the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter API, and the schedule library to schedule the tweets to be sent at specific times. In this example, the script is set to tweet the message "Hello, Twitter!" at 10:30 AM and 5:00 PM every day.

You will need to replace the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret placeholders with your own Twitter API credentials, which you can obtain by creating a Twitter developer account and creating a new app.

You can also modify the message being tweeted, the timing of the tweets, and the frequency at which they are sent by editing the appropriate lines of code.

Please be aware of twitter developer agreement and policy while posting tweets automatically and in some cases, they might require additional permissions or review of your application.
